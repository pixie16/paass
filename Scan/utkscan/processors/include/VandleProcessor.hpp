/** \file VandleProcessor.hpp
 * \brief A class to handle VANDLE bars
 *
 *Processes information from the VANDLE Bars, allows for
 *beta-gamma-neutron correlations. The prototype for this
 *code was written by M. Madurga.
 *
 * Currently, the code is set to recognize two types of starts: LeRIBSS style
 * and the new Double Beta starts (SiPMT implementation). I have currently
 * coded things to be mutually exclusive. If there are Double Beta Starts then
 * the code will not analyze the LeRIBSS style starts. This is to alleviate a
 * potential confusion when it comes to the histogramming. This problem will be
 * resolved at a later date. -SVP 12/17/2014
