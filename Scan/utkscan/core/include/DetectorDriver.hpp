/*! \file DetectorDriver.hpp
 *  \brief Main Driver for event processing.
 * \author S. N. Liddick
 * \date July 2, 2007
 *
 * The main analysis program.  A complete event is create in PixieStd
 * passed into this class. In this file are the details for experimental
 * processing of a raw event created by ScanList() in PixieStd.cpp.  Event
 * processing includes things that do not change from experiment to experiment
 * (such as energy calibration and raw parameter plotting) and things that do
 * (differences between MTC and RMS experiment, for example).
 * See manual for further details.
 *
 * SNL - 7-2-07
 * SNL - 7-12-07
 *       Add root analysis. If the ROOT program has been
 *       detected on the computer system the and the
 *       makefile has the useroot flag declared, ROOT
 *       analysis will be included.
 * DTM - Oct. '09
 *      Significant structural/cosmetic changes. Event processing is
 *      now primarily handled by individual event processors which
 *     handle their own DetectorDrivers
 *
 * SVP - Oct. '10
 *       Added the VandleProcessor for use with VANDLE.
 *       Added the PulserProcessor for use with Pulsers.
 *       Added the WaveformProcessor to determine ps time resolutions.
 * KM  - Dec. '12, Jan. '13
 *       Huge changes due to switching to XML configuration file.
 *       See git commits comments.

    * have been created.  Then experiment specific processing is performed.

    * has occured, appropriate plotting routines are called.
