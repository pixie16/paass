/** \brief The all important raw event
 *
 * The rawevent serves as the basis for the experimental analysis.  The rawevent
 * includes a vector of individual channels that have been deemed to be close to
 * each other in time.  This determination is performed in ScanList() from
 * PixieStd.cpp.  The rawevent also includes a map of detector summaries which
 * contains a detector summary for each detector type that is used in the analysis
 *
 *  The rawevent is intended to be versatile enough to remain unaltered unless
 * LARGE changes are made to the pixie16 code.  Be careful when altering the
 * rawevent.
