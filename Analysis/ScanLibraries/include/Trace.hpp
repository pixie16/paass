/// @brief This defines a more extensible implementation of a digitized trace.
/// The class is derived from a vector of unsigned integers. This is the basic
/// form of a trace from most digitizers. The Trace class enables processed
/// information about the trace (such as the baseline, integral, etc.).
///
/// We also store information about the Waveform. The waveform is the part
/// of the trace that actually contains information about the signal that
/// was captured. This excludes the baseline.
