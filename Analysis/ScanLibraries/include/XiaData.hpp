/*! \brief A pixie16 channel event
 *
 * All data is grouped together into channels.  For each pixie16 channel that
 * fires the energy, time (both trigger time and event time), and trace (if
 * applicable) are obtained.  Additional information includes the channels
 * identifier, calibrated energies, trace analysis information.
 * Note that this currently stores raw values internally through pixie word types
 *   but returns data values through native C types. This is potentially non-portable.
