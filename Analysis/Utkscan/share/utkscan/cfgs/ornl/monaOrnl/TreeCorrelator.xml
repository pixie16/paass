<!--
     Instructions:
     Create here tree of "places" build of <Place> elements for
     your experiment. Basic places are created automatically from entries in 
     the map2.txt file using type_subtype_location pattern.
     Root element should be named <TreeCorrelator>, and may have 'description'
     attribute with comment about experiment in concern.

     Each <Place> element has following attributes:
        'name' - required, if last token in name (tokens are separated by '_')
                characters are in format X-Y,Z where X, Y and Z
                are integers, a whole range X to Y is assumed 
                (e.g.  beta_0-1,5,9-10
                will create beta_0, beta_1, beta_5, beta_9 and beta_10 )

        Optional attributes:
        'type' - must be one of types defined in PlaceBuilder.cpp (see there)
                currently available are: PlaceDetector, PlaceThreshold,
                PlaceThresholdOR, PlaceCounter, PlaceOR, PlaceAND
                if type is not used or empty (type="") it is assumed that
                place already exists. In particular this is true for all 
                basic places created from channels as defined in map2.txt
        'replace' - if set to 'true', will replace existing place with a
               one defined in this element. 
        'fifo' - depth of FIFO of place
        'coincidence' - defines type of relation with parent (true of false)
        'low_limit', 'high_limit' - required for PlaceThreshold and
                PlaceThresholdOR defines threshold limits (calibrated energy).

        see PlaceBuilder for other type of places and attributes.
