    <Description>
        A timing setup to measure time difference between two pulser signals
    </Description>

    <!-- Instructions:
        Global scan parameters are setup here.

        Required fields are:
        * <Revision version="X"/> where X is A, D or F
        * <EventWidth units="x" value="y"/>
            where unit must be s, ms, us or ns; value is floating point
        * <EnergyContraction value="x" />
            OBSOLETE, please do not use energy contraction (consider
            calibration instead), however if needed for backward compatibility
            put here floating point number
        * <Path>relatative_path</Path>
            where 'relative_path' is a path to the other configurations
            files not included into this xml document. At the moment these
            are: qdc.txt, timingConstants.txt, timingCal.txt
            relative_path must end with '/' unless is empty (which points
            to the current directory then)
        * <NumOfTraces value="x" />
            where x is unsigned integer giving the maximum number of
            traces in 2D traces histograms. This number is rounded up
            to the power of 2, since DAMM histograms must have such sizes
        * <HasRaw value="true/false"/>
            This will enable or disable plotting of the raw histograms 1-1900
            in the DAMM histogram. You will still get most of the 1800 IDs since
            they are always useful (e.g. run time).

            Add

            and

            for each processor or analyzer you want to use.

            List of known Processors:
               * TwoChanTimingProcessor - Enables analysis of our data
               (experiment specific processor)
            List of known Analyzers:
               * FittingAnalyzer - Fits the waveforms to extract phase
                   * Required Argument: type="XXX" (currently only gsl supported)
               * TraceExtractor - Plots some traces for us in DAMM
               * WaveformAnalyzer - Finds the waveform and other information
                    about the trace.

    <!-- Instructions:
         Channels map. This section replaces the map.txt (map2.txt) and cal.txt
         files. For each channel in each module that you want to use in
         analysis you must assign some physical detector type (and subtype)
         which is known to the pixie_scan (see DetectorLibrary.cpp).
         A channel may be also calibrated (by default a raw channel number
         from adc is used) or corrected against walk (by default walk
         correction is equal to 0).

         The root element (<Map>) may have attributes changing the verbosity
         level during loading of the configuration in this section. These are
         * verbose_map - Loaded modules and channels
         * verbose_calibration - Calibration
         * verbose_walk - Walk correction
         Each attribute default to False, if change to True will show more
         messages concerning loaded parameters etc.

    <!-- Instructions:
         This node contains information related to traces. All of the information
         input into this node related to times should be in nanoseconds (ns).

         * TrapezoidalWalk - The "walk" of the trapezoidal filter in ns. This is
                             used when finding the waveform in the trace. It
                             accounts for the fact that low amplitude signals
                             come later in the trace. Default = 266
         * TraceDelay - The value of the trace delay from the set file used to
                        take the data. No Default value
         * TraceLength - How long the traces are. Taken from the set file. No
                         Default value
         * Waveform Range - The range that the waveform has in the trace. It is
                            taken as [MaxPosition - Low, MaxPosition+High].
                            Default value is [5,10].
